# Presentation #

This addon was created following a request from a member on the nvda-addons mailing list.

It provides a keyboard shortcut, NVDA + F4, which allows to retrieve and give the language of the current keyboard.

If pressed twice, gives the default language of the system.

At the first version of this module, it had been proposed as simple globalPlugin to paste in the configuration directory of NVDA, it was then transformed into addon.

## Notes ##
