# sayCurrentKeyboardLanguage

* Author(s): Abdel, Noelia.

# Presentation #

This addon was created following a request from a member on the nvda-addons mailing list.

It provides a script without gesture, which allows to retrieve and give the language of the current keyboard.

If pressed twice, gives the default language of the system.

At the first version of this module, it had been proposed as simple globalPlugin to paste in the configuration directory of NVDA, it was then transformed into addon.

## Notes ##

To set a gesture to the script giving the keyboard language, follow these steps:

* Open the NVDA's menu, with "NVDA + N";
* Go to NVDA's preferences menu;
* Then go to the submenu "Input gestures".
* Then select the category "Input", and open it with right arrow.
* Go to the item labeled "Gives the language of the keyboard in use, if pressed twice, give the default language of the system";
* Once done, press Alt + A to add a gesture, and type "NVDA + F4" or another gesture of your choice;
* This done, press the up arrow once, you hear "your chosen gesture, all layout";
* Validate on enter, then tab to OK then enter;
* Your chosen gesture should then call the script giving keyboard language.
